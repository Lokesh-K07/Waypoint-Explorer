# 🌐 Waypoint Explorer

**Waypoint Explorer** is a Flask-based web application designed to plan optimal driving routes in **Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, India**. It leverages **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** data via the `osmnx` library to generate shortest and tourism-optimized routes between user-specified locations.

The application includes:

- 🧠 Machine learning models for travel time prediction and tourism popularity scoring
- 🗺️ Interactive map visualizations using **Folium**
- 🏨 Nearby recommendations (accommodations, restaurants, and hospitals within 3 km)

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Route Planning**: Compute the shortest and tourism-optimized routes using the **A\*** search algorithm.
- **Travel Time Prediction**: Estimate travel time based on distance, vehicle type (car, bike, auto), and time of day using a linear regression model.
- **Tourism Place Popularity**: Score tourism places based on distance from the city center, nearby amenities, and accessibility using ML.
- **Nearby Recommendations**: Suggest accommodations, restaurants, and hospitals with distance, rating, and images.
- **Interactive Maps**: Display routes and points of interest on **Folium** maps.
- **Caching**: Store OSM graph and route data to improve speed.
- **Autocomplete Search**: Provide real-time location suggestions.

## 📦 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- Internet connection (for the initial OSM data download)

---

## 🖼️ Prepare Static Assets

Ensure the following image files are present in the `static/images/` directory:

- `rk_beach.jpg`
- `Feel_Like_Home_RK_beach.jpg`
- `aha.jpg`
- `nri.jpeg`

Additionally, include any other relevant images extracted from your `visakhapatnam_data` dataset (such as landmark images, place thumbnails, etc.) into the same `static/images/` directory.
